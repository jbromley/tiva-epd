Tiva C EPD Demo
===============

This project is a demo of the Pervasive Displays e-Ink displays with 
the Tiva C Launchpad board. The code is based on the repaper/gratis 
code. This project uses the EPD driver code from repaper and implements
GPIO and SPI functionality using the API from the repaper code. Note that
this project does not use any TivaWare code as I wanted it to be as free
of dependencies as possible.

The Makefile and directory structure are based on the tiva-template project.
